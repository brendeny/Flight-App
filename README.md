# Flight Schedule Personal Project CPSC 210 - by Brenden Yee

## Proposal

In my personal project, I plan to design a **flight schedule** application that allows users to store and organize 
upcoming flights that they have. This will be used by travelers for both personal and business related flights. 

Users will be able to add the following:

- flight dates
- flight times
- flight numbers
- gate numbers
- departure and arrival airport
- boarding times
- takeoff times
- landing times

These will be added to a schedule which can then be requested by the user to see the chronological order of the
schedule of flights they have. The application will guide users through what information they should input to help
ensure the users do not forget important information that they will need for their flights. I hope to expand the scope
of the project throughout the term to include other possible features.

## User Stories

- As a user I want to be able to add a new flight to a list of flights
- As a user I want to be able to view my current list of flights
- As a user I want to be able to remove a flight from the list of flights
- As a user I want to be able to select a flight and see the flight date
